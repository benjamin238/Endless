# The so called Open Source Software
## Prohibiting beyond GPL 3.0 and why it's unethical.
Open Source is great. It's so great in fact, that it's underrated. We have a community developing OSS on a mass scale and it is innovating the future of software, even in proprietory environments. 
This software model has even proved itself in business models, and companies like Red Hat have proved that OSS can be profitable and beneficial for both the seller and consumer. 
However, OSS only works if the original holder understands their rights and is aware of what they are permitting and prohibiting. When a holder isn't aware, or is aware and intentionally being prohibitive, Open Source fails.

### Prohibiting an aspect that was designed to protect contributors.
You can't just add a the GPL-3.0 license and then not follow it yourself, then prohibit others from modifying or redistributing for their own purpose. This is against the license, and the holder **cannot legally do anything about it** *as long as the other party that is redistributing or modifying are following GPL-3.0*.

Intentionally preventing people from this is violating the whole idea of GPL ethically.
The foundations and ideas of GPL [from the GNU Site by Brett Smith](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html) are:
- the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
- the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
- the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and
- the freedom to share the changes you make.
