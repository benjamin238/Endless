# The so called Open Source Software
### Prohibiting beyond GPL 3.0 and why it's unethical.
Open Source is great. It's so great in fact, that it's underrated. We have a community developing OSS on a mass scale and it is innovating the future of software, even in proprietory environments. 
This software model has even proved itself in business models, and companies like Red Hat have proved that OSS can be profitable and beneficial for both the seller and consumer. 
However, OSS only works if the original holder understands their rights and is aware of what they are permitting and prohibiting. When a holder isn't aware, or is aware and intentionally being prohibitive, Open Source fails.

#### Prohibiting an aspect that was designed to protect contributors.
