# Endless Install Instructions
**Warning: Support is not provided for those wanting to self-host Endless. Do not ask for assistance or support.**
### Part One: Preparing your VPS
Please make sure you have the following installed:
- Maven (mvn)
- MySQL Server (mysql-server)
- Git (git)
- OpenJDK 11 Headless (openjdk-11-jdk-headless)
- Endless Bot Source (https://github.com/caution3/Endless/)
*You'll want to clone from my repo, and not the official one, as the official one does not contain the files needed to setup the bot.*
