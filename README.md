# Endless (caution3 edit)
**NOTE: The original Endless Repo as of 18th October 2018, was taken down, however, thanks to the magic of GPL, we've used our magic to keep this repo in hopes of it becoming useful... somehow.**

Endless was a Discord bot originally written by Artuto in Java using [Java Discord API (JDA)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities) "with love".

It is being rehosted as Artuto removed it from his own repo, however as it was released under the GPL (While he also violated it), we are rehosting it for the purpose of keeping code online and free.

## So called 'Open Source'

Endless is license under GNU GPL 3.0 License, that means you can go here and look how something works, but, if you are using it on your own bot please remember to give credit to this repository.

EDIT: GPL 3.0 allows you to redistribute, modify and publish the source code as you please, even for commercial use, however, you need to attribute the original project, which is right [here](https://github.com/caution3/Endless). (This is not legal advice.)

Also, any changes made to any piece of code published here may be stated.

**If you are told that you are not allowed to rehost or modify the bot, do not believe that. GPL 3.0 gives you every right to do that as long as you are in compliance with it. GPL 3.0 is designed to protect the people that keep OSS in the community and use it for their own things.**

### Significant Changes (courtesy of caution3)
- Removed some redundant and bullshit code in StartupChecker.java which stopped users other than Artuto from being able to run and be an operator of a custom build of the bot. 10/10 Open Source. [Commit](https://github.com/caution3/Endless/commit/0897b6ddf3d7da8d21c4ad2500daad40b1aa1806)
- Added INSTALL instructions because the original developer won't. [Commit](https://github.com/caution3/Endless/commit/8b3c8cb2df01c6d9090e537f095722d855489235)
