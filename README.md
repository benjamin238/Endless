# Endless (caution3 edit)

Endless is a Discord bot written by Artuto in Java using [Java Discord API (JDA)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities) with love ‚ù§.

## So called 'Open Source'

Endless is license under GNU GPL 3.0 License, that means you can go here and look how something works, but, if you are using it on your own bot please remember to give credits to me.

EDIT: GPL 3.0 allows you to redistribute, modify and publish the source code as you please, even for commercial use, however, you need to attribute the original project, which is right [here](https://github.com/EndlessBot/Endless). (This is not legal advice.)

Also, any changes made to any piece of code published here may be stated.

EDIT: **If you are told that you are not allowed to rehost or modify the bot, do not believe that. GPL 3.0 gives you every right to do that as long as you are in compliance with it. GPL 3.0 is designed to protect the people that keep OSS in the community and use it for their own things.**

### Significant Changes (caution3)
- Removed some redundant and bullshit code in StartupChecker.java which stopped users other than Artuto from being able to run and be an operator of a custom build of the bot. 10/10 Open Source. [Commit](https://github.com/caution3/Endless/commit/0897b6ddf3d7da8d21c4ad2500daad40b1aa1806)
- Added INSTALL instructions because the original developer won't. [Commit](https://github.com/caution3/Endless/commit/8b3c8cb2df01c6d9090e537f095722d855489235)


## Editing the source code

I won't provide support when editing the source code to create a custom build of Endless (unless its going to be a [pull request](https://github.com/EndlessBot/Endless/pulls)).
